non - equilibrium radiation diffusion is an important mechanism of energy transport in inertial confinement fusion , astrophysical plasmas , furnaces and heat exchangers . in this paper ,   an analytical solution to the non - equilibrium marshak diffusion problem in a planar slab and spherical shell of finite thickness is presented . using laplace transform method ,   the radiation and material energy densities are obtained as a function of space and time .   the variation in integrated energy densities and leakage currents are also studied . in order to linearize the radiation transport and material energy equation   , the heat capacity is assumed to be proportional to the cube of the material temperature .   the steady state energy densities show linear variation along the depth of the planar slab , whereas non - linear dependence is observed for the spherical shell .   the analytical energy densities show good agreement with those obtained from finite difference method using small mesh width and time step .   the benchmark results obtained in this work can be used to validate and verify non equilibrium radiation diffusion computer codes in both planar and spherical geometry .      key - words : non - equilibrium radiation diffusion , analytic solution , finite planar slab , spherical shell , laplace transform method , finite difference pacs : 44.05.+e , 44.40.+a
